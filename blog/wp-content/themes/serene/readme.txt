CUSTOMIZING SERENE'S COLORS

	1. Adjusting The Overall Layout - You can adjust the theme's case colors via the Theme 
	Customizer. Once the theme has been enabled, click the Appearances > Customizer link to
	open the customizer options. Under the "Theme Settings" section, you can adjust the 
	highlight color. The default is Orange. 

	2. Adjusting The Color Of Individual Posts - You can also adjust the font and background 
	colors of each post you create. When you create a new post, locate the "Post Settings" 
	box below the text editor. Here you will see options for "Background Color" and "Post 
	Text Color." If you choose a dark background color, then you should set your "Post Text 
	Color" to Light. For example, in the following post we have the Background Color set to 
	#507c90 and the Post Text Color set to "Light."

USING SERENE'S POST FORMATS

	Serene is a blog theme that supports 6 different post formats: Standard, Video, Audio, 
	Quote, Gallery and Link. When you write a new post, you can choose which type of format 
	you would like to use via the "Format" box on the right side of the screen. 

	1. Standard - A standard blog post does not contain any media elements other than the 
	post text and an image. You can define a header image using the "Featured Image" 
	box to "Set featured image."

	2. Video - When the Video format is selected, a video is embedded into the header of 
	the post and is played when the visitor clicks the play icon. To add a video post, select 
	the "Video" format and then simply add a link to a Youtube or Vimeo video in your post. 
	The theme will automatically grab the first video you like to and use it in the header.

	3. Audio - When the audio format is selected, the post displays a custom audio player 
	interface that can play a single audio file. To create an Audio post, select the "Audio" 
	post format and then use the "Add Media" link above the post editor to embed an audio 
	file into your post. The theme will automatically use the first audio file embedded in 
	your post within the post's header.

	4. Quote - The Quote post format takes the first block quote from your post and display it 
	in your post's header. To create a quote post, select the "Quote" post format and then add 
	a "block quote" to your post. The first block quote in your post will be used in the header. 

	5. Gallery - A gallery post will display a gallery of images within a slider in your post's 
	header. To create a gallery post, select the "Gallery" post format, and then use the "Add 
	Media" button above the post editor to add a new gallery to your post. The first gallery 
	added to your post will automatically be used in the header of your post.

	6. Link - A link post is used for sharing a link, and it will display your link/link title 
	in the header of the post. To create a link post, select the "Link" post format and then 
	add a new link to the body of your post. The first link in your post will be pulled into 
	the header and featured. 



CONFIGURING SOCIAL MEDIA BUTTONS
	You can configure the social media buttons via the Appearances > Customizer panel. Once
	opened, look for the "Theme Settings" section and fill in the URL options for each profile. 
	To disable the links, simply leave each field blank.
